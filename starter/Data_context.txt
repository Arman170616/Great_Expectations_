Create a Data Context

In Great Expectations, your Data Context manages your project configuration, so letâ€™s go and create a Data Context for our tutorial project!


When you installed Great Expectations, you also installed the Great Expectations command line interface (CLI). It provides helpful utilities for deploying and configuring Data Contexts, plus a few other convenience methods.

To initialize your Great Expectations deployment for the project, run this command in the terminal from the ge_tutorials directory:

'''

great_expectations init

'''
When you see a prompt, press enter to continue. Great Expectations will build out the directory structure and configuration files it needs for you to proceed. All of these together are your Data Context.
